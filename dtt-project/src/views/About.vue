    <h2>About DTT Real Estate</h2>
    <p>
      From a student room in 2010 to a full-service digital agency in the heart
      of Amsterdam. Our story is one of those. A story we are very proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      We - the 60+ enthusiastic strategists, designers, developers and testers -
      who work together daily on the most beautiful projects. And we have been
      doing so since 2010 for small and large clients - from independent
      entrepreneurs, startups, the public sector and SMEs, to multinationals
      like Randstad and nonprofits like Greenpeace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clients with diverse objectives, target groups and resources, challenging
      us time and again to develop a suitable digital solution. As a team, this
      makes us rich in experience, flexible and enormously versatile. And that
      is precisely where our strength lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Driven: </span> As a team, we are genuinely committed
      to our clients and their goals. From the first brainstorming session, the
      strategy, the development and implementation of the solution, right
      through to ongoing support.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Accessible:</span> We make the digital world as
      accessible as the solutions we develop. We gladly take clients through the
      development process and we enter their interesting (working) territory
      with just as much enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Results-oriented:</span> All decisions within the
      design and development process are based on a data-driven strategy. With
      tangible insights, we help clients achieve maximum results. Again and
      again.
